To be able to follow along, you should start with the first post. Otherwise, the following won't make much sense üòÅ.\n\nThis tutorial covers the example where the underlying model is given by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).\n\nHere is [the Stan code for this example](stancode-ode.stan) and this is [the R script that runs everything](cmdstanr-ode-script.R).\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nA while ago, I wrote [a series of tutorials](/posts/2022-02-22-longitudinal-multilevel-bayes-1/) that discuss fitting longitudinal data using Bayesian multilevel/hierarchical/mixed-effects models.\n\nFor the first few posts in this series, I used the [`rethinking`](/posts/2022-02-22-longitudinal-multilevel-bayes-2/) and [`brms`](/posts/2022-02-22-longitudinal-multilevel-bayes-3/) packages to run `Stan` models in `R`, without having to write `Stan` code. \n\nIn those examples, I had a simple model that captured the longitudinal data (in my example, virus load) trajectory.\n\nFor a research project, I now want to implement a model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). I figured to understand what I'm trying to do, I should first teach myself and write it up in a tutorial. \n\nOne can use packages like `rethinking` or `brms` with ODE models, but one still has to write some `Stan` code. I decided instead, for my purpose, it is better to write the full model in `Stan` and then fit it through `cmdstanr` in R.\n\nThe prior two posts show [one of the original models](/posts/2024-02-15-longitudinal-multilevel-bayes-5/) and a [more complex model](/posts/2024-02-16-longitudinal-multilevel-bayes-6/) implemented in Stan. I assume you read those posts. In this post, I'll move on to an ODE-based model.\n\n\n\n\n# The idea\n\nThe most common types of models used to describe data are those that are non-mechanistic -- or phenomenological, like [I like to call them](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-019-0235-3). What's meant by that is that the model represents a convenient and suitable way to describe the data, but does not try to capture any information about the underlying mechanisms of the system and processes that led to the observed data.\n\nIn contrast, mechanistic models are -- very simplified -- representations of the assumed or known underlying processes. As such, they allow incorporation of expert knowledge, and are potentially better at providing a fuller understanding of the system - but also require such a better understanding at the start to even allow using such models. \n\nThat's all I'll say about these models, you can learn more in [this review article I wrote with colleagues](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-019-0235-3) or on [this website](https://andreashandel.github.io/SMIcourse/). Both of these resources are immunology-focused, but the general concepts are the same for any subject matter area.\n\nA common way of implementing mechanistic models that describe the dynamics of some system is through ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This is the approach I'll be taking here.\n\n\n## The ODE model\n\nAs a reminder, our outcome/data of interest are virus load time-series trajectories of individuals following infection.\n\nTo get an ODE model that can capture the shape of our data, I use a simple basic virus dynamics model. I won't explain this model here, if you want to learn more about these kind of models, see for instance [this short write-up](https://andreashandel.github.io/SMIcourse/A_Few_Simple_Models.html#Simple_Viral_Infection_Model) on my [Simulation Modeling for Immunologists website](https://andreashandel.github.io/SMIcourse/) or [this reference](https://www.nature.com/articles/nri700).\n\nHere are the model equations\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\textrm{uninfected cells:} \\qquad  \\dot U & = -\\beta_i UV \\\\ \n\\textrm{infected cells:} \\qquad  \\dot I & = \\beta_i UV - \\gamma_i I \\\\\n\\textrm{virus:} \\qquad  \\dot V & = \\alpha_i I - \\eta_i V\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThis model has 4 parameters, each is indexed by $i$ to indicate that it can differ between individuals. For any ODE model, one needs to not only specify the model parameters but also the starting values of each quantity. To keep things simple, below I assume that the number of uninfected cells and infected cells is known and the same for each individual, and that the virus load is given by the experimental conditions, i.e. the dose. More generally, it would be possible to let the starting values vary and estimate them from the data.\n\nWhile the model tracks the dynamics of 3 quantities, we only have data for one, namely the virus $V$. The time-series obtained for $V$ by solving these ODEs is what is now assumed to be the average trajectory, namely what we formerly called $\\mu$ in the statistical model.\n\n\n## The new statistical model\n\nThe overall structure of the model structure remains the same from the previous example. The difference is that now the virus trajectory is described by an ODE model.\n\nThese are the components of the new model, now with an ODE model describing the deterministic part.\nI'm not sure what the best mathematical notation is, here is an option.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\textrm{Outcome} \\\\\nY_{i,t}   \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}\\left(\\log(V_{i,t}), \\sigma\\right) \\\\\n\\\\\n\\textrm{ODE model defining V} \\\\\n\\dot U  = -\\beta_i UV \\\\ \n\\dot I  = \\beta_i UV - \\gamma_i I \\\\\n\\dot V  = \\alpha_i I - \\eta_i V \\\\\n\\\\\n\\textrm{Deterministic models for main parameters} \\\\\n\\alpha_{i}   =  a_{0,i} + a_1 \\left(\\log (D_i) - \\log (D_m)\\right)  \\\\\n\\beta_{i}   =  b_{0,i} + b_1 \\left(\\log (D_i) - \\log (D_m)\\right) \\\\\n\\gamma_{i}   =  g_{0,i} + g_1 \\left(\\log (D_i) - \\log (D_m)\\right) \\\\\n\\eta_{i}   =  e_{0,i} + e_1 \\left(\\log (D_i) - \\log (D_m)\\right) \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis model is similar in structure to the previous non-mechanistic ones. Each model parameter depends on the dose as well as potentially on individual differences. The main difference is that to obtain the time-series for the outcome (here, virus load), we need to integrate the ODE model at each iteration of the Stan sampler.\n\n\nTo fully specify the model, we need to give all parameters distributions. \nHere are the distributions for the population-level parameters. These do not vary between individuals.\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\textrm{population-level priors} \\\\\n\\sigma  \\sim \\mathrm{HalfCauchy}(0,1)  \\\\\na_1 \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(0.1, 0.1) \\\\\nb_1 \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(-0.1, 0.1) \\\\\ng_1 \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(0.1, 0.1) \\\\\ne_1 \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(-0.1, 0.1) \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\nIn addition, we allow some parameters to differ between individuals, and we'll implement hyper-parameters to allow these values to inform each other across individuals. This is again the adaptive prior concept from earlier.\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\textrm{individal-level priors} \\\\\na_{0,i} \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu_a, \\sigma_a) \\\\\nb_{0,i}  \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu_b, \\sigma_b) \\\\\ng_{0,i} \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu_g, \\sigma_g) \\\\\ne_{0,i}  \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu_e, \\sigma_e) \\\\\n\\\\\n\\textrm{hyper priors} \\\\\n\\mu_a  \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(3, 1) \\\\\n\\mu_b  \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(1, 1) \\\\\n\\mu_g  \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(3, 1) \\\\\n\\mu_e  \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(1, 1) \\\\\n\\sigma_a  \\sim \\mathrm{HalfCauchy}(0,1)  \\\\\n\\sigma_b  \\sim \\mathrm{HalfCauchy}(0,1)  \\\\\n\\sigma_g  \\sim \\mathrm{HalfCauchy}(0,1)  \\\\\n\\sigma_e  \\sim \\mathrm{HalfCauchy}(0,1)  \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAnd that's the full model. Again, it is similar to the previous models, but now we need to implement an ODE model with Stan. \n\n\n\n# Model implementation\n\n\n\nWe previously used the `brms` and `rethinking` R packages to run our `Stan` models in `R`, without having to write `Stan` code. One can use these packages for ODEs, but still has to write some `Stan` code. I decided instead, for flexibility, I'm writing the full model in `Stan` and then fit it through `cmdstanr` in R.\n\n\n\n## Stan model code\n\nhttps://stanpmx.github.io/\n\nhttps://mpopov.com/tutorials/ode-stan-r/\n\nhttps://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2023-05-16_stan-ode/\n\nhttps://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2023-05-16_stan-ode/#when-biology-isnt-analytically-tractable\n\nhttps://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/ode-solver.html\n\n\nhttps://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2023-06-10_pop-pk-models/\n\n\n\n\n# Summary and continuation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
