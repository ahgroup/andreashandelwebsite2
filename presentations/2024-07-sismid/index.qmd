For the 16th time, my colleague Paul Thomas and I taught our annual SISMID workshop. For the first time in Atlanta. The workshop website is [here](https://andreashandel.github.io/SISMID2024/). Most materials are found on a dedicated, stand-alone website called [Simulation Modeling in Immunology](https://andreashandel.github.io/SMIcourse/).
