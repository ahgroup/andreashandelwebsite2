# Overview

This tutorial will continue [the series of posts](/posts/2022-02-22-longitudinal-multilevel-bayes-1/)
showing how to fit longitudinal data using Bayesian multilevel/hierarchical/mixed-effects models. To be able to follow along, you should start with the first post. Otherwise, the following won't make much sense üòÅ.

**As of right now, it's still work in progress. Stay tuned for a working example in hopefully the near future.**
